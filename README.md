# Face Generation Project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

## Project Overview
This is Face Generation Project for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. In this project I use **Generative Adversarial Networks** (GAN's) to generate new images of faces using MNIST and CelebA databases. 

## Prerequisites

The code is **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and it uses:

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can install everything you need to run this project with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

## Installing
Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/rauf-mifteev/DLND_Face_Generation.git`

## Run the Code
Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with dlnd_face_generation.ipynb:

`jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb`
